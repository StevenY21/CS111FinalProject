# CS111FinalProject
This repository holds the final project completed by me and fellow student Sashank Krishna for CS111
This project is a solver for 8-puzzle. We start with a 9x9 "board" and that has 8 tiles in a random state, and want to make it so that the tiles reach a goal state. There are mutliple different state-space search algorithms that are used to get from starting position to the goal position of the board. In class, we used this to test which search algorithm was the most effective for certain boards that are can be optimized to be done in a certain amount of steps.
